**Pure SVG Countdown** is a Proof of Concept that we can build a dynamic timer with only CSS3 Animation & SVG, no need for JavaScript.

## About

The project is inspired by [StyleCampaign](https://stylecampaign.com/blog/2016/04/building-a-dynamic-svg-timer/). The purpose of the project is to demonstrate how amazing CSS3 and SVG they are.

A server-side generated SVG animation can be used in:

- Email
- Forum/BBS that only supports `[img][/img]`
- WeChat Official Accounts Article UI/UX

Just name a few.
